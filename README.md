## Hello!
I'm Sophia. (She/Her)   
I'm a trans girl who programs mostly for fun.   
As in, I only really program in whatever language interests me the most at the time, unless I have a specific idea in mind.   
If I do, then I use one of the two things most familiar to me: Scratch and Lua (ComputerCraft: Tweaked & CraftOS-PC).   
I've learned a bit of C, a little more of Java, and a good chunk more of JavaScript, but I'm nowhere near as good at any of those as I am at Lua.   
I mostly just use GitHub to store my files for easy download in ComputerCraft, or to host parts of my websites.
